## 2. OBJECTIVES

This research project aims to develop an innovative Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for intelligent traffic simulation in Hong Kong. The proposed system will democratize access to advanced traffic simulation tools by enabling users to generate, customize, and analyze complex urban mobility scenarios by interacting with fine-tuned LLMs, allowing users without high-level traffic simulation expertise to evaluate future traffic policies, development programs, or interventions and their impacts; ultimately reducing congestion, controlling traffic-related emissions, improving road network efficiency, and advancing driving safety in Hong Kong.

### 3.1 Multi-Source Traffic Data Integration and Intelligent Processing

We will establish a multi-source data fusion framework to integrate heterogeneous traffic data streams including video surveillance feeds (data.gov.hk), LiDAR point clouds (3d.map.gov.hk), road network data (www.td.gov.hk, www.openstreetmap.org), and textual traffic incident reports (data.gov.hk). The framework could enable automated data preprocessing pipelines to extract critical traffic parameters such as flow rates, vehicle speeds, density distributions, incident locations, and temporal patterns, converting them into both structured formats (e.g., time-series matrices, spatial networks) and natural language descriptions that LLMs can comprehend and process.

The data fusion module will implement advanced anomaly detection algorithms leveraging LLM's contextual reasoning abilities to automatically identify irregular traffic patterns such as sudden congestion, accidents, special events, or infrastructure failures. The system will maintain a continuously updated digital representation of Hong Kong's transportation network, integrating data from transport department's traffic detectors, CCTV networks, public transport information, parking occupancy sensors. This multi-modal data integration will provide a high-fidelity foundation for the LLM-driven simulation system, ensuring that generated simulation scenarios accurately reflect real-world Hong Kong traffic characteristics including the unique geographical features and high-density mixed traffic patterns typical of the city.

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Text-to-Simulation System Architecture and Platform Integration

This part will develop a scalable multi-agent text-to-simulation system that seamlessly integrates with established microscopic traffic simulation platforms such as SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility). The system will feature a modular architecture with API integration layers, including Planner Agent (central orchestrator), Tool Layer (simulation utilities), and State Management (workflow coordination), to enable bidirectional communication between traffic simulation platforms and users. The Planner Agent, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, will serve as an intelligent interface that translates natural language user inputs into structured simulation commands, automatically invoking appropriate tools in the correct sequence to generate complete traffic scenarios from high-level descriptions such as "simulate morning peak hour traffic in Central with 20% increase in ride-hailing vehicles."

### 3.3 Domain-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning for Traffic Simulation Modules

This part will develop specialized fine-tuning strategies to adapt LLMs for diverse traffic simulation generation tasks, recognizing that different simulation components require distinct reasoning capabilities and domain knowledge. The fine-tuning program will target five critical simulation generation modules: 

(1) Road Network Generation - training LLMs to accurately interpret OpenStreetMap data for Hong Kong, handle complex junction types (roundabouts, slip roads, multi-level interchanges), and generate valid network files with appropriate lane configurations and connectivity; (2) Geographic Feature Generation - enabling LLMs to identify and instantiate Points of Interest (POI) such as shopping centers, offices, schools, and Areas of Interest (AOI) including residential zones, business districts, and industrial areas, serving as the origin and destination (OD) points of trips and ensuring realistic spatial activity distributions; (3) Travel Demand Generation - fine-tuning agents to produce OD matrices, daily activity patterns, and trip chains that reflect Hong Kong's unique travel behavior characteristics derived from household travel surveys and mobile signaling data; (4) Traffic Assignment and Route Planning - enabling LLMs to generate and iterate on route choice sets, pathfinding constraints, and dynamic assignment strategies (e.g., stochastic user equilibrium, real-time rerouting under incidents) consistent with Hong Kong’s corridor and tunnel bottlenecks; (5) Traffic Signal Control and Priority - fine-tuning models to design and validate intersection control plans, green wave coordination, public transport priority, and adaptive signal logic aligned with local junction geometries and regulatory standards.

### 3.4 Simulation Validation and Evaluation

To ensure reliability and accuracy, we will implement a comprehensive validation process calibrating simulation outputs against real-world Hong Kong traffic data. Quantitative validation will compare simulated and observed metrics (travel times, speeds, density, congestion patterns). Qualitative validation through expert assessments will ensure behavioral realism and alignment with Hong Kong's unique characteristics. In the application of the simulation system, we will evaluate impacts of potential traffic policy interventions, future development programs, and emerging mobility services. Policy scenarios include congestion pricing, dynamic signal optimization, road space reallocation, and incident management. Development assessments will examine major infrastructure projects and their effects on regional traffic distribution. Emerging mobility evaluations will cover autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing expansion, and micro-mobility integration. For each scenario, the system will generate comparative metrics (travel time, density, VKT, emissions, accessibility) to conduct rapid iterative policy testing, supporting evidence-based transportation planning for more sustainable and efficient urban mobility in Hong Kong.
