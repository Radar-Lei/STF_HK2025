### 3.1 Multi-Source Traffic Data Integration and Intelligent Processing

We will establish a multi-source data fusion framework to integrate heterogeneous traffic data streams including video surveillance feeds, LiDAR point clouds, GPS trajectory data, and textual traffic incident reports from Hong Kong's existing ITS infrastructure. The framework could enable automated data preprocessing pipelines to extract critical traffic parameters such as flow rates, vehicle speeds, density distributions, incident locations, and temporal patterns, converting them into both structured formats (e.g., time-series matrices, spatial networks) and natural language descriptions that LLMs can comprehend and process.

The data fusion module will implement advanced anomaly detection algorithms leveraging LLM's contextual reasoning abilities to automatically identify irregular traffic patterns such as sudden congestion, accidents, special events, or infrastructure failures. The system will maintain a continuously updated digital representation of Hong Kong's transportation network, integrating data from Transport Department's traffic detectors, CCTV networks, public transport arrival information, parking occupancy sensors, and emerging connected vehicle platforms. This multi-modal data integration will provide a high-fidelity foundation for the LLM-driven simulation system, ensuring that generated scenarios accurately reflect real-world Hong Kong traffic characteristics including the unique geographical features (mountainous terrain, harbor crossings, multi-level elevated roads) and high-density mixed traffic patterns typical of the city.

### 3.2 Multi-Agent Text-to-Simulation System Architecture and Platform Integration

This research will develop a scalable multi-agent text-to-simulation system that seamlessly integrates with established microscopic traffic simulation platforms including SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) and MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation). Building upon the successful frameworks of ChatSUMO and AgentSUMO, the system will feature a modular architecture comprising a Planner Agent (central orchestrator), Tool Layer (simulation utilities), and State Management (workflow coordination). The Planner Agent, powered by state-of-the-art LLMs, will serve as an intelligent interface that translates natural language user inputs into structured simulation commands, automatically invoking appropriate tools in the correct sequence to generate complete traffic scenarios from high-level descriptions such as "simulate morning peak hour traffic in Central with 20% increase in ride-hailing vehicles."

The system will implement comprehensive API integration layers that enable bidirectional communication with SUMO/MATSim platforms, handling data format conversions (XML configuration files, route definitions, network topology), parameter passing, simulation execution, and results retrieval. The architecture will support three operational modes: (1) Fully automated pipeline where LLM agents autonomously construct scenarios from natural language to execution; (2) Interactive mode enabling iterative refinement through conversational exchanges; and (3) Batch processing mode for policy comparison experiments. Critical technical components include a Translation Engine that converts LLM natural language outputs into simulation-ready formats, a Query Builder that constructs structured prompts from user intentions, and a Verification Module that validates generated scenarios for feasibility and consistency before execution, ensuring reliable simulation results for Hong Kong transportation planning applications.

### 3.3 Domain-Specific LLM Fine-Tuning for Traffic Simulation Components

This research will develop specialized fine-tuning strategies to adapt LLMs for diverse traffic simulation generation tasks, recognizing that different simulation components require distinct reasoning capabilities and domain knowledge. The fine-tuning program will target five critical simulation generation modules: (1) Road Network Generation - training LLMs to accurately interpret OpenStreetMap data for Hong Kong, handle complex junction types (roundabouts, slip roads, multi-level interchanges), and generate valid SUMO/MATSim network files with appropriate lane configurations and connectivity; (2) Geographic Feature Generation - enabling LLMs to identify and instantiate Points of Interest (POI) such as shopping centers, offices, schools, and Areas of Interest (AOI) including residential zones, business districts, and industrial areas, ensuring realistic spatial activity distributions; (3) Travel Demand Generation - fine-tuning agents to produce human-like origin-destination matrices, daily activity patterns, and trip chains that reflect Hong Kong's unique travel behavior characteristics derived from household travel surveys and mobile signaling data.

The fine-tuning approach will employ a combination of techniques including supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets (e.g., historical traffic scenarios, expert-designed simulation configurations), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for incorporating traffic engineering knowledge bases. For route planning and traffic assignment, LLMs will be trained to apply established principles (e.g., user equilibrium, stochastic route choice) while adapting to real-time conditions. Critically, for signal intersection timing optimization, the system will fine-tune LLMs to validate and generate signal control schemes based on Webster's method, green wave coordination principles, and adaptive signal control logic, ensuring that generated timing plans are both theoretically sound and practically implementable. Each specialized LLM will undergo rigorous validation against ground-truth scenarios and expert-designed benchmarks to ensure high fidelity simulation outputs for Hong Kong's transportation digital twin applications.

### 3.4 Policy Evaluation for Hong Kong's Ride-Hailing Service Regulation

This research will leverage the developed LLM-driven simulation framework to conduct comprehensive policy evaluation studies addressing Hong Kong's imminent deregulation of ride-hailing services under the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025. As Hong Kong prepares to introduce a licensing regime for ride-hailing platforms, vehicles, and drivers, critical questions remain regarding the optimal number of ride-hailing vehicle permits (with proposals ranging from 10,000+ vehicles), their impact on existing taxi operations, and effects on overall traffic conditions. The simulation system will enable rapid scenario generation to evaluate multiple permit quota configurations (e.g., 5,000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 ride-hailing vehicles) and their potential impacts on network-wide traffic flow, congestion levels, travel times, emissions, and public transport ridership across different Hong Kong districts during peak and off-peak periods.

Beyond quota analysis, the research will systematically evaluate various policy interventions and traffic management strategies to mitigate potential negative externalities of ride-hailing service expansion. Simulation experiments will assess the effectiveness of measures including: dynamic congestion pricing in core business districts (Central, Admiralty, Wan Chai), designated ride-hailing pickup/drop-off zones to reduce cruising behavior, preferential treatment for electric ride-hailing vehicles, integration with public transport hubs, and time-of-day operational restrictions. The LLM-based framework will enable transportation planners to pose "what-if" questions in natural language (e.g., "How would a \$50 congestion charge in Central during 8-10 AM affect ride-hailing demand and overall traffic speeds?") and receive rapid simulation-based answers with detailed visualizations (heatmaps, flow diagrams, temporal trend charts). This capability will provide evidence-based decision support for the Transport and Logistics Bureau and Legislative Council as they finalize subsidiary legislation and operational guidelines, ensuring Hong Kong's ride-hailing regulation promotes sustainable urban mobility while maintaining road network efficiency and public transport viability.
