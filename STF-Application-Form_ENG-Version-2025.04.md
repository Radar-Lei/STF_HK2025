This project will build an LLM-centric traffic simulation framework to assess how Hong Kong ride-hailing policies influence congestion; natural-language interaction lets non-specialists generate, adjust, and analyze complex urban traffic scenarios to cut congestion, curb emissions, and improve network efficiency and safety. We fuse video surveillance, road network data, traffic accident reports, and ride-hailing platform operations, and develop a multi-agent text-to-simulation system seamlessly linked to a microscopic simulator so prompts (e.g., "simulate a 20% ride-hailing increase during Central's morning peak") yield full scenarios directly. Behavioural surveys of drivers and passengers will be converted into simulation parameters, while five core modules—network generation, geographic feature recognition, travel-demand generation, traffic assignment and routing, and signal control-receive targeted LLM fine-tuning enriched with ride-hailing factors such as pick-up/drop-off

zones, demand elasticity, and dispatch behaviour; expected outcomes include stronger traffic-management decisions, quantified congestion/diversion across policy options, clearer road-safety assessment, evidence for smart-city and smart-mobility planning, and emission reductions through better policy design.

V. Relevance to the Scope of the Fund

1. Please provide details on how the project relates to the Scope of the Smart Traffic Fund, namely 'Enhancing convenience of motorist', 'Enhancing efficiency of the road network or road space', 'Improving driving safety', and relevant Government's policies, including the 'Smart City Blueprint for Hong Kong 2.0's and/ or 'Smart Mobility Roadmap for Hong Kong' for promoting smart mobility in Hong Kong.

Smart mobility is one of the six major areas<sup>5</sup> mentioned in the 'Smart City Blueprint for Hong Kong 2.0' published by the Government in December 2020, and our proposed LLM-Enhanced Smart Mobility Simulation Platform directly supports the blueprint's emphasis on data-driven traffic management and intelligent transport systems. The project aligns with the SIGMA vision<sup>6</sup> presented in the 'Smart Mobility Roadmap for Hong Kong' by establishing a robust data fusion framework that integrates multi-source traffic data including video surveillance,  traffic detectors, and ride-hailing operational data to create a comprehensive digital representation of Hong Kong's transportation network. Through LLM's advanced natural language processing capabilities, the platform democratizes access to sophisticated simulation tools by enabling transport planners and policymakers to generate and evaluate complex traffic scenarios through natural language interactions, making it informative and accessible to diverse stakeholders beyond specialized traffic engineers. The system addresses the critical challenge of emerging mobility services management by providing a framework for assessing congestion impacts of ride-hailing policies including licensing regimes, vehicle caps, and fare regulations. Additionally, the platform supports green and sustainable transport objectives by evaluating emissions, vehicle kilometers traveled, and modal shift patterns under different regulatory scenarios, helping identify policies that minimize environmental footprint while optimizing ride-hailing operations to reduce empty running and promote shared rides.

Regarding enhancement of motorist convenience and road network efficiency, the platform enables systematic evaluation of policies that improve the overall mobility experience and infrastructure utilization. The simulation system assesses ride-hailing availability and wait times under different licensing scenarios, evaluates the effectiveness of designated pick-up/drop-off zones in minimizing conflicts between ride-hailing operations and general traffic flow, and analyzes integration with parking facilities and public transport interchanges to optimize door-to-door journey convenience. The platform delivers quantitative assessment of congestion impacts when introducing or expanding ride-hailing services, including detailed analysis of effects on bottleneck locations, critical tunnel capacities, and CBD traffic circulation patterns that are particularly sensitive in Hong Kong's constrained road network. Through simulation of temporal and spatial restrictions including peak-hour operational limitations and geofencing strategies, the platform helps identify regulatory frameworks that manage ride-hailing vehicle distribution and prevent excessive concentration in already-congested areas, while optimizing dispatch and rebalancing strategies to minimize empty running and maximize vehicle utilization efficiency.

With Hong Kong actively considering legalization and regulation of ride-hailing services, timely and accurate assessment of congestion impacts has become crucial for informed policy design. The project provides critical decision-support capabilities for the Transport Department to rapidly evaluate proposed regulations and traffic management measures before real-world implementation, and supports the Environmental Protection Department in quantifying emissions impacts to align mobility needs with air quality objectives. Our platform addresses this pressing need by providing a scientifically rigorous, computationally efficient, and user-friendly tool that enables diverse stakeholders including policymakers, transport planners, researchers, and industry participants to understand complex trade-offs, optimize regulatory frameworks, and ensure that emerging mobility services contribute positively to Hong Kong's transport system performance and environmental sustainability while enhancing the mobility experience for all residents and visitors.

VI. Innovation and Technology Components

## 1. Technical Proposal

Please provide details on the viability of the proposal from the technical perspective, including R&D methodology to achieve each milestone, details of each milestone and the responsible parties, preliminary research results and supporting data, and the targeted results.

### Technical Background

The upcoming legalization of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong presents a unique opportunity to understand the market penetration dynamics of platform-based mobility services and their impacts on urban traffic congestion. While ride-hailing platforms have been adopted in many cities worldwide, Hong Kong's distinct context—characterized by high public transport mode share (over 90% of daily trips), limited road capacity, and an established taxi fleet—requires rigorous evidence-based assessment to inform policy implementation. The Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 establishes a three-tiered regulatory framework for platforms, vehicles, and drivers, yet critical questions remain regarding vehicle permit caps, fare arrangements, operational hours, and data-sharing requirements. Traditional traffic impact assessment methods, relying on static demand forecasting and limited behavioral data, are insufficient to capture the complex interactions between ride-hailing supply, passenger demand, and congestion patterns. This project addresses this gap by developing an integrated research framework that combines longitudinal data construction, behavioral surveys, and LLM-enhanced traffic simulation to provide robust estimation of ride-hailing impacts on congestion under various policy scenarios.

The technical approach builds upon recent advances in three domains. First, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of natural language understanding and code generation has enabled text-to-simulation systems such as ChatSUMO and TrafficGPT, which lower the barrier for non-experts to generate complex traffic scenarios. Second, microscopic traffic simulation platforms like SUMO and MATSim provide validated frameworks for modeling vehicle-level interactions, route choice, and network-level congestion propagation. Third, quasi-experimental methods including difference-in-differences (DID) and interrupted time series analysis have been applied to evaluate the causal effects of transportation policy interventions. By integrating these methodologies, this project will develop a comprehensive platform for simulating ride-hailing legalization scenarios, parameterized by empirical behavioral data from two-wave surveys and validated against real-world traffic observations.

### Multi-Source Data Integration Framework

The foundation of robust congestion impact estimation lies in the construction of a comprehensive longitudinal dataset that captures the evolution of ride-hailing and taxi operations before and after legalization. This project will establish a multi-source data fusion framework integrating five primary data streams: (1) administrative records from the Transport Department on taxi licenses, vehicle registrations, and planned ride-hailing permits; (2) publicly available traffic detector data and CCTV feeds from data.gov.hk covering key corridors and intersections; (3) ride-hailing platform operational data including trip origins, destinations, timestamps, and surge pricing events, obtained through data-sharing agreements stipulated in the regulatory framework; (4) traditional taxi GPS trajectory data from taxi operators; and (5) road network data from OpenStreetMap and the Transport Department including junction geometries, signal timings, and designated pick-up/drop-off zones.

The data integration pipeline implements a three-stage process to ensure spatial-temporal alignment and quality control. In the preprocessing stage, raw data streams undergo format standardization, coordinate transformation (WGS84 to Hong Kong 1980 Grid System), and timestamp synchronization to 5-minute intervals. Anomaly detection algorithms based on isolation forests and DBSCAN clustering identify and flag irregular patterns such as sensor malfunctions, GPS drift, or data transmission errors. The fusion stage employs map-matching algorithms to project trajectory data onto the road network graph, generating link-level flow, speed, and occupancy time series. Pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) events are spatially aggregated into 500m×500m grid cells to construct origin-destination demand matrices while preserving privacy. The validation stage cross-references traffic detector counts with CCTV-derived vehicle counts (using computer vision object detection) and taxi GPS-inferred flows to establish data quality metrics including completeness ratio \( C_r = N_{obs}/N_{exp} \), where \( N_{obs} \) is observed records and \( N_{exp} \) is expected records, and consistency score \( S_c = 1 - |Q_{detector} - Q_{GPS}|/Q_{detector} \) comparing detector flow \( Q_{detector} \) and GPS-inferred flow \( Q_{GPS} \).

The longitudinal dataset will cover an 18-month observation window: 9 months pre-legalization (baseline period) and 9 months post-legalization (treatment period), with data collection commencing three months prior to the anticipated enactment date. This duration is sufficient to capture seasonal variations, special events (e.g., holidays, major exhibitions), and the gradual market adjustment process as ride-hailing permits are allocated and drivers onboard platforms. The dataset will support quasi-experimental analyses including difference-in-differences estimation of congestion impacts, with treatment intensity measured by neighborhood-level ride-hailing trip density and control variables including population density, employment centers, public transport accessibility, and weather conditions.

### Behavioral Survey and Sampling Design

Understanding that ride-hailing legalization impacts congestion through a behavioral transmission mechanism—where driver entry and operational decisions influence both supply- and demand-side travel choices, subsequently altering traffic flow and speeds—this project implements a dual verification framework to validate simulation model accuracy. The framework comprises two modules: a behavioral change monitoring module tracking online hours, deadheading distance, and detour behavior to identify whether driver actions exacerbate congestion post-legalization, and a congestion impact assessment module measuring changes in link speeds following policy implementation. By comparing simulated outputs against observed behavioral changes and speed variations, we calibrate model parameters to avoid spurious replication of congestion patterns that misrepresent underlying behavioral mechanisms, ensuring robust policy scenario predictions.

To parameterize and validate the simulation model, this project conducts two-wave data collection at critical observation points: Wave 1 (pre-legalization baseline) and Wave 2 (post-implementation). Wave 1 data calibrate the simulation's decision functions (passenger mode choice, carpooling willingness, driver order acceptance, cruising strategies) and individual characteristic distributions (wait time tolerance, price sensitivity, incentive response elasticity, work hour flexibility), while Wave 2 data validate model predictions (passenger wait time, mode shift, driver deadheading ratio, detour distance) and refine parameter constraints. The driver survey addresses six dimensions grounded in labor economics and transport geography: entry decision capturing willingness to register and reservation wage, labor supply elasticity measured through scenario-based questions yielding temporal elasticity parameter \( \epsilon_t = (\Delta H/H_0)/(\Delta W/W_0) \), spatial operating preferences across districts, request acceptance behavior analyzed via multinomial logit discrete choice models, surge pricing sensitivity under varying multipliers, and trip records documenting pick-up/drop-off locations, timestamps, distances, fares, and routing patterns (optional detour data). These records enable construction of empirical distributions for deadheading ratio \( = \sum(\text{deadheading miles})/\sum(\text{deadheading + trip miles}) \) and cruising mode choice functions \( Pr(\text{mode}|\text{influencing factors}) \). The passenger survey covers four dimensions: trip characteristics (purpose, frequency, origin-destination pairs), mode choice determinants through stated preference experiments yielding utility parameters \( U_{im} = \beta_{price} \cdot Price_{im} + \sum \beta_{others} \cdot Others + \gamma X_i + \epsilon_{im} \) via Hierarchical Bayes estimation, service quality and price sensitivity measured by Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter, and travel records logging modes, origins, destinations, travel times, and prices to calibrate actual demand patterns and modal substitution matrices.

The sampling design employs a two-stage stratified approach for drivers, stratifying Hong Kong's 18 districts by taxi supply density and ride-hailing demand potential, then randomly selecting recruitment locations with probability proportional to taxi flow, ensuring representation across shift types and experience levels. For passengers, we combine random-digit-dialing and online panel recruitment, with post-stratification to Census 2021 distributions. Sample size determination employs statistical power analysis targeting \( 1-\beta \geq 0.80 \) power at \( \alpha = 0.05 \) significance, using paired t-test formula \( n = [(Z_{1-\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\beta})^2 \cdot 2\sigma^2]/(\mu_2 - \mu_1)^2 \), accounting for expected panel attrition. The final recruitment target is approximately **350 drivers and 500 passengers per wave**, with progressive compensation incentivizing longitudinal retention and enabling robust calibration of simulation behavioral parameters against observed post-legalization changes in link speeds and traffic patterns.

### LLM-Enhanced Traffic Simulation Architecture

The core innovation of this project lies in the integration of Large Language Models with microscopic traffic simulation to enable accessible, natural language-driven scenario generation and analysis. The system architecture follows a modular design comprising four principal components: the Planner Agent (LLM orchestrator), the Tool Layer (simulation utilities), the State Management module (workflow coordinator), and the Visualization & Analysis Engine. This architecture builds upon recent advances in LLM-agent systems such as ChatSUMO and TrafficGPT while extending their capabilities to incorporate ride-hailing-specific demand modeling and congestion impact assessment.

The Planner Agent, powered by a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1 70B model, serves as the central orchestrator that interprets natural language user inputs and translates them into structured simulation commands. The fine-tuning process employs a domain-specific corpus comprising 50,000 transportation scenario descriptions paired with corresponding SUMO configuration files (road networks, demand matrices, vehicle types, signal plans). The training objective is a next-token prediction task with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align outputs with expert preferences. A typical user input might be: "Simulate morning peak hour traffic in Central and Western District with 10,000 licensed ride-hailing vehicles operating under 1.5× surge pricing, comparing congestion levels against current baseline." The Planner Agent performs intent recognition (simulation task = scenario comparison), entity extraction (location = Central & Western, time = 07:00-10:00, vehicle_permit = 10000, surge_multiplier = 1.5), and workflow planning (steps: generate baseline network, generate treatment network, run parallel simulations, compute difference metrics).

The Tool Layer provides a comprehensive suite of simulation utilities exposed as Python functions callable by the Planner Agent through function calling API. These tools are organized into five categories corresponding to the simulation pipeline:

(1) **Network Generation Tools**: `generate_network_from_osm(bbox, vehicle_classes)` downloads OpenStreetMap data for specified bounding box and converts it to SUMO network format, incorporating ride-hailing PUDO zones identified from survey hotspot analysis. `add_pudo_areas(network, zones, time_limit)` designates curb segments as pick-up/drop-off areas with maximum dwell time constraints (e.g., 3-minute limit) to model curb management policies. `calibrate_capacity(network, traffic_detector_data)` adjusts link capacities and saturation flows based on empirical observations, addressing Hong Kong's unique mixed traffic conditions (buses, taxis, goods vehicles).

(2) **Demand Generation Tools**: `generate_od_matrix(trip_purpose, time_period, ride_hailing_share)` constructs origin-destination demand matrices by combining base trip distribution from Hong Kong Travel Characteristics Survey with ride-hailing demand elasticity parameters estimated from passenger surveys. The demand model follows a nested logit structure where users first choose whether to make a trip (trip generation), then select destination (trip distribution), then choose mode (mode choice: private car, taxi, ride-hailing, public transport), and finally choose route (route assignment). The ride-hailing demand \( D_{ij}^{RH}(t) \) from zone \( i \) to zone \( j \) at time \( t \) is modeled as:

\[
D_{ij}^{RH}(t) = D_{ij}^{total}(t) \cdot P_{ij}^{RH}(t)
\]

where \( P_{ij}^{RH}(t) \) is ride-hailing mode share given by the multinomial logit model:

\[
P_{ij}^{RH}(t) = \frac{\exp(V_{ij}^{RH}(t))}{\sum_{m \in M} \exp(V_{ij}^{m}(t))}
\]

The systematic utility \( V_{ij}^{RH}(t) = \beta_c \cdot c_{ij}^{RH}(t) + \beta_t \cdot t_{ij}^{RH}(t) + \beta_w \cdot w_{ij}^{RH}(t) + \beta_{comfort} + \epsilon \) includes fare \( c \), in-vehicle time \( t \), wait time \( w \), comfort constant, and error term. Survey-estimated parameters \( \beta_c, \beta_t, \beta_w \) are injected into this demand module.

(3) **Ride-Hailing Operation Tools**: `simulate_platform_dispatch(algorithm, matching_radius, wait_time_threshold)` implements platform matching algorithms (nearest-driver, batching, rebalancing) calibrated to survey-measured driver acceptance patterns. `model_driver_supply(time_of_day, surge_multiplier)` generates time-varying driver availability based on survey-elicited labor supply elasticity. If surge multiplier rises from 1.0 to 1.5, the active driver count increases according to:

\[
N_{drivers}(surge) = N_{baseline} \cdot (1 + \epsilon_s \cdot \ln(surge))
\]

where \( \epsilon_s \) is the surge elasticity parameter estimated from Wave 2 survey responses. `generate_rebalancing_trips(idle_locations, demand_hotspots)` models deadheading behavior when drivers relocate from low-demand to high-demand areas without passengers, contributing to vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) but not passenger-kilometers.

(4) **Traffic Assignment and Simulation Tools**: `assign_routes(od_matrix, network, route_choice_model)` performs dynamic traffic assignment using the C-Logit model to account for route overlap, with path travel time updated iteratively based on simulated congestion. `run_sumo_simulation(config, duration, step_length)` executes SUMO microscopic simulation with 1-second time steps, modeling car-following (Krauss model), lane-changing (LC2013 model), and junction dynamics. Ride-hailing vehicles are parameterized with distinct behavioral attributes: shorter minimum headways (reflecting professional driver behavior), higher lane-change assertiveness, and dwell time distributions at PUDO zones sampled from survey-reported pickup durations.

(5) **Signal Control Tools**: `optimize_signal_timings(junctions, traffic_flows)` applies Webster's formula for cycle length optimization and max-pressure control algorithms for adaptive signal plans, evaluating whether signal retiming can mitigate ride-hailing-induced congestion.

The State Management module maintains simulation context across user interactions, implementing a workflow graph where nodes represent simulation states (baseline network, treatment network, simulation results) and edges represent transformations (parameter modifications, scenario variants). This enables iterative exploration: a user can generate a baseline, then sequentially modify ride-hailing permit cap (5000 → 8000 → 10000) and compare congestion metrics across scenarios without regenerating the base network. The module employs differential simulation, where only modified components are re-executed, reducing computational time by 60-70% for parameter sensitivity analyses.

The Visualization & Analysis Engine post-processes simulation outputs to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with policy objectives. Congestion metrics include network-wide Vehicle Hours Traveled (VHT) \( \sum_{v,t} 1 \) for all vehicles \( v \) and time steps \( t \), Vehicle Hours Delay (VHD) \( \sum_{v,t} (1 - v_t/v_{free}) \) where \( v_t \) is actual speed and \( v_{free} \) is free-flow speed, and Time Mean Speed (TMS) \( \bar{v} = (\sum_{v} L_v / T_v) / N_v \) where \( L_v \) is trip length and \( T_v \) is trip time for vehicle \( v \). Ride-hailing impact is quantified by the difference estimator:

\[
\Delta VHD = VHD_{treatment} - VHD_{baseline}
\]

with statistical significance assessed through bootstrapping (1000 resamples of demand matrices). Environmental metrics include CO₂ emissions computed from fuel consumption using SUMO's HBEFA model, and accessibility metrics measure the percentage increase in resident access to 30-minute trip destinations. The LLM Planner Agent generates natural language summaries interpreting these metrics: "Introducing 10,000 ride-hailing vehicles with current regulatory parameters increases network delay by 8.2% (95% CI: 6.1-10.5%), equivalent to 1.7 additional minutes per trip on average. Peak-hour congestion on Connaught Road Central worsens by 15%, while off-peak impacts are negligible (<2%). Policy levers to mitigate impacts include: (1) restricting peak-hour operations (reduces delay to 5.1%), (2) mandating electric vehicles (no congestion impact but 12% emissions reduction), (3) implementing congestion pricing in Central (reduces delay to 3.8%)."

### Model Calibration and Validation

Ensuring the simulation model accurately represents Hong Kong's traffic system requires a rigorous calibration and validation process that establishes credibility for policy analysis. The process follows a hierarchical structure addressing four levels: network supply, demand patterns, traffic dynamics, and ride-hailing-specific operations.

Network supply calibration begins with geometry validation, where link lengths, number of lanes, speed limits, and junction configurations in the SUMO network are cross-referenced against Transport Department road inventory data and Google Street View imagery. Capacity calibration employs the Traffic Flow Fundamental Diagram approach: traffic detector data providing paired observations of flow \( q \) (vehicles/hour) and occupancy \( o \) (%) are plotted to identify capacity \( C \) (maximum flow) and jam density \( k_j \) (vehicles/km). The theoretical relationship \( q = C \cdot (1 - k/k_j) \) (Greenshields model) is fitted to observations, and SUMO's capacity parameters are adjusted until simulated fundamental diagrams match empirical curves within 5% RMSE. Signal timing calibration synchronizes simulation signal plans with actual phasing, cycle lengths, and offsets obtained from Transport Department signal databases. For actuated signals, detector placement and green extension parameters are tuned to replicate observed queue discharge patterns captured in CCTV footage.

Demand pattern calibration matches simulated link flows against traffic detector counts across a representative 24-hour period. The calibration objective minimizes the GEH statistic, a modified chi-squared measure commonly used in traffic modeling:

\[
GEH = \sqrt{\frac{2(q_{sim} - q_{obs})^2}{q_{sim} + q_{obs}}}
\]

The target is GEH < 5 for at least 85% of links and GEH < 10 for 95% of links, thresholds established by UK Highways Agency validation guidelines. Calibration proceeds through iterative proportional fitting (IPF) of the origin-destination matrix, where cell values \( T_{ij} \) are adjusted using the Fratar method:

\[
T_{ij}^{(k+1)} = T_{ij}^{(k)} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{O_i^{target}}{O_i^{sim}} + \frac{D_j^{target}}{D_j^{sim}} \right)
\]

where \( O_i \) and \( D_j \) are origin and destination totals. Temporal demand patterns are validated against Travel Characteristics Survey trip start time distributions using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (\( p > 0.05 \) indicating no significant difference).

Traffic dynamics validation assesses whether the simulation replicates emergent phenomena including congestion formation, propagation, and dissipation. Travel time validation compares simulated journey times against Google Maps API historical travel time data for 50 major OD pairs across different time periods (AM peak, PM peak, off-peak). The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) target is <15%:

\[
MAPE = \frac{100\%}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{TT_{sim,i} - TT_{obs,i}}{TT_{obs,i}} \right|
\]

Speed-flow relationships are validated by comparing simulated speed-flow curves against detector observations, ensuring the model captures congestion onset (transition from free-flow to congested regime) and hysteresis effects. Queue length validation uses CCTV-derived queue counts at signalized intersections during peak hours, targeting <20% error in maximum queue length.

Ride-hailing-specific validation leverages data from existing platforms operating in other cities (e.g., Uber/Lyft in San Francisco, Didi in Shenzhen) to validate behavioral submodels. Wait time distributions are validated against published statistics: the simulated median wait time \( w_{50,sim} \) should match reported platform data \( w_{50,obs} \) within 2 minutes. Trip distance distributions are compared using the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to ensure simulated trip length distribution matches platform-reported distributions. Driver utilization rate (fraction of time with passenger) is validated against literature-reported values (typically 50-60% for ride-hailing vs. 70-80% for taxis). Surge pricing impacts are validated through a quasi-experimental design: the simulation's predicted supply response to surge events (driver activation and relocation) is compared against published studies quantifying surge elasticity (e.g., Chen et al. 2019 finding \( \epsilon_s = 0.3 \) for Uber).

Post-legalization, the model undergoes continuous recalibration as real operational data becomes available. Monthly model updates incorporate: (1) actual ride-hailing trip data from mandated platform reporting, refining demand elasticity parameters; (2) CCTV-observed PUDO dwell times, updating service time distributions; (3) traffic detector-measured speed changes, validating congestion predictions. A rolling validation window maintains model accuracy: each month's simulation is compared against subsequent actual observations, with discrepancies triggering parameter review. This adaptive calibration approach transforms the simulation from a prediction tool into a digital twin that co-evolves with the real transportation system, maintaining decision-support relevance throughout the legalization transition.

### Expected Technical Outcomes and Performance Targets

The technical development will achieve the following quantifiable outcomes and performance benchmarks. The LLM-enhanced simulation platform will demonstrate text-to-simulation conversion capability processing natural language scenario descriptions in <30 seconds, generating SUMO-compatible network and demand files with 95% accuracy (measured by expert evaluation of 100 test prompts). The system will support concurrent simulation of at least 50,000 vehicles across Hong Kong Island and Kowloon networks (approximately 1,500 km² coverage) with 1-hour simulation time completing in <10 minutes on standard workstation hardware (32GB RAM, 8-core CPU). Scenario comparison functionality will enable parameter sweeps across 20+ policy levers (permit caps, fare rules, operating hours, vehicle age limits) generating comparative congestion metrics within 2 hours.

Survey data collection will achieve panel retention rate >75% between Wave 1 and Wave 2, with post-stratification weights ensuring sample representativeness within 5% of census benchmarks across key demographics. Behavioral parameter estimation will attain precision targets: 95% confidence intervals for key elasticity parameters (surge response, labor supply) spanning <0.3 units, sufficient for meaningful policy simulation. Model validation will meet or exceed international best-practice thresholds: GEH <5 for 85% of links, travel time MAPE <15%, queue length error <20%. Ride-hailing demand prediction post-legalization will achieve MAPE <25% for monthly trip volumes, with uncertainty quantification through ensemble forecasting (combining 10 parameter sets sampled from survey posterior distributions).
