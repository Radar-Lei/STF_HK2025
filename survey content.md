To construct the simulation platform that accurately reflects the impact of ride-hailing operations on urban traffic congestion, this project designed a questionnaire targeting both ride-hailing drivers and passengers. The primary objective of the questionnaire is to transform individual behavioral intentions and decision-making patterns into quantifiable input parameters for the simulation model. These parameters are categorized into two main types: the operational behavior of drivers on the supply side and the travel profiles of passengers on the demand side.

On the supply side, the driver survey focuses on five key dimensions: (1) response to ride-hailing legalization, including willingness to become a driver after legalization and current occupation, to estimate the increase in driver numbers post-legalization; (2) employment type (full-time or part-time) and current occupation (for part-time drivers only), to determine drivers' available service time windows; (3) operational elasticity, measured through scenario-based questions regarding temporal elasticity (service hours), spatial elasticity (operating areas), and income elasticity (service duration under varying income levels); (4) request matching and route choice preferences, encompassing preferences for long versus short trips, behavior in no-order states (cruising or waiting), and route selection strategies under congestion; and (5) decision-making mechanisms, primarily examining sensitivity to dynamic pricing, criteria for order rejection, and changes in work frequency under adverse external conditions. On the demand side, the passenger survey primarily covers: (1) trip characteristics, including trip purpose, usage frequency, and typical origin-destination types; (2) service selection preferences, such as temporal distribution of ride requests, tolerance for waiting time, and price sensitivity; and (3) alternative travel modes adopted when ride-hailing is unavailable or not the preferred option.
