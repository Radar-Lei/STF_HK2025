Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025

Background brief

Purpose

This paper provides background information on the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 ("the Bill") and summarizes the major views and concerns expressed by the Panel on Transport ("the Panel") during discussions on related matters.

## Background

2. In recent years, the transport mode of booking personalized point-to-point transport services online ("ride-hailing services") has become increasingly common worldwide. The Government proposes to introduce a clear legislative framework to regulate the operation of ride-hailing platforms, with a view to safeguarding passenger safety, providing diverse travel options, and promoting complementary strengths and healthy competition between taxis and ride-hailing vehicles, thereby fostering the long-term healthy development of the personalized point-to-point transportation industry.

## Proposed regulatory framework

3. The Administration proposes that platforms, vehicles and drivers that provide ride hailing services should be licensed and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements on safety standards and service quality. Ride hailing platforms should also be responsible for conducting due diligence on their vehicles and drivers to ensure that the passenger transport services provided are in compliance with local legislation. For specific regulatory requirements for ride-hailing platforms, vehicles and drivers, please refer to paragraphs 16 to 29 of the Legislative Council ("LegCo") Brief (File ref.: TLB CR 240-001-007).

4. The Administration proposes to first introduce the Bill into LegCo at this stage for establishing the regulatory framework and stipulating provisions on matters of principle that have already been agreed upon by society and the LegCo. As for other technical details (e.g. the number of vehicle permits, the level of licence/permit fees, etc.), the Administration will continue to discuss and negotiate in a focused manner with various stakeholders, with a view to incorporating them into subsidiary legislation to be introduced into LegCo in the first half of 2026 or licence/permit conditions as appropriate.

## Combating illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward more effectively

5. In order to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward more effectively, the Administration proposes to amend the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) ("the Ordinance") to clearly specify that if a person is convicted of an offence of illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise, his/her driving licence should be disqualified for not less than 12 months and not more than three years. Furthermore, it is noted that some of the vehicle owners involved refused to provide information on the driver who might have been involved in illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward \( {}^{1} \) . As a result, the Police cannot institute prosecutions as they cannot confirm the identity of the driver concerned \( {}^{2} \) . In this regard, the Administration proposes to amend the Ordinance to the effect that even if no prosecution can be instituted against the driver involved due to various reasons, the vehicle licence may still be temporarily suspended and the vehicle delivered to the Commissioner for Transport ("the Commissioner") for custody for a period of six months \( {}^{3} \) .

1 At present, when a vehicle owner receives a "Notice Requiring Provision of Personal Particulars of Driver" issued by the Police under section 63 of the Ordinance, requiring the vehicle owner to provide information about the driver of a vehicle that may be involved in an offence under the Ordinance (including illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward) or a traffic accident, the vehicle owner must provide the relevant information to the police officer within the period specified in the Ordinance.

2 Under the existing Ordinance, if a person is convicted of the offence under section 52(3) of the Ordinance (i.e. illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward), the vehicle licence of the vehicle involved will be temporarily suspended and the vehicle delivered to the Commissioner for custody. The suspension period is either six months (for first conviction) or 12 months (for subsequent conviction).

3 The Government is finalizing the details of the specific procedures and working on the law drafting. It intends to propose amendments to the Bill regarding the details, with a view to incorporating the related provisions into the Bill.

Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025

6. The Bill seeks to amend the Ordinance to:

(a) provide for the regulation of ride-hailing service;

(b) introduce a licensing regime for ride-hailing platforms, ride-hailing vehicles and drivers of such vehicles;

(c) provide for the regulation of any other public vehicle passenger transport service booked through licensed ride-hailing platforms;

(d) enhance the enforcement regime against illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward; and

(e) provide for related matters.

The Bill would come into operation on a day to be appointed by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics by notice published in the Gazette.

Discussions of the Panel

7. At its meeting on 18 July 2025, the Panel was consulted on the legislative proposal to regulate ride-hailing services. Members generally agreed with and supported the formulation of a three-pronged regulatory framework and policy principles for the platforms, vehicles and drivers providing ride-hailing services. The major views and concerns expressed by Members are summarized in the ensuing paragraphs.

## Regulatory Framework for ride-hailing services

8. Members considered the development of ride-hailing services to be an inevitable trend, and that the Administration should formulate a regulatory framework as early as practicable to meet public travel needs, safeguard passenger safety, and foster a positive competitive environment for the personalized point-to-point transport service industry. Some Members proposed establishing a tripartite consultation mechanism comprising the Government, ride-hailing platform companies ("platform companies") and drivers to provide a channel for discussion on matters such as ride-hailing operations, fare, driver protection and passenger dispute resolution. It was also suggested that the regulatory framework should be forward-looking, giving full consideration to the application and development of future technologies such as driverless vehicles.

9. The Administration advised that it would continue to listen to the views of various stakeholders on the specific details of the regulatory framework. Platform companies would also be required to set up a complaint handling mechanism and a rating system for driver services to ensure service quality and safeguard passengers' interests. In drawing up the regulatory framework, the Government would give due consideration to the application of technology and the development trends of the sharing economy, with a view to facilitating the development of ride-hailing services and the trades.

## Fare arrangements for ride-hailing services

10. Some Members expressed concern about the fare disparity between ride-hailing vehicles and taxis. As taxi fares are regulated by the Government, they argued that allowing ride-hailing services to charge a fee that is below taxi fare levels would create unfair competition for the taxi trade. It was therefore suggested that the Administration should use the taxi flagfall fare as a reference when setting ride-hailing fares, or introduce a minimum fare for ride-hailing services. Additionally, some Members advocated for the introduction of an aggregator platform that would enable passengers to view and compare fares offered by different platform companies for ride-hailing service booking on a single platform.

11. The Administration responded that the proposed regulatory framework for ride-hailing services was intended to promote healthy competition among ride-hailing platforms, while preventing cut-throat reductions in fares or excessive pricing. Furthermore, the Administration proposed that fare setting for ride-hailing services should be market-driven, but ride-hailing platforms would be required to inform passengers of the fare arrangements before the start of a journey. At the same time, the Administration would retain the power to regulate fare arrangements when necessary, for example in case of market imbalances or extreme situations that might affect the healthy development of the trade.

## Operational data and insurance arrangements

12. Some Members suggested that the regulatory framework should stipulate that platform companies must share data relating to ride-hailing services with the Administration for formulating smart mobility policies. It was also suggested that such data should be stored in Hong Kong. Some Members also raised concern about the ownership of the data. Additionally, as ride-hailing vehicles can be used for private purposes when not providing ride-hailing services, making it difficult to determine insurance premiums, some Members suggested that insurance companies should develop insurance products and set appropriate premiums based on the number of hours a ride-hailing vehicle was used for providing ride-hailing services.

13. The Administration advised that it would further explore the insurance arrangements with the insurance sector, in the hope that the relevant insurance products would be able to provide protection for passengers without discouraging owners of ride-hailing vehicles from providing ride-hailing services. Appropriate measures would also be put in place to ensure data security, including careful consideration of matters such as data access.

## Number and regulation of ride-hailing vehicles

14. A number of Members expressed concern over the cap on the total number of ride-hailing vehicles. Some suggested that at least 10000 ride-hailing vehicle permits should be issued, while others proposed that the cap in Hong Kong be determined with reference to the respective numbers of licensed taxis and ride-hailing vehicles, as well as the ratio between them in other regions. Besides, some Members expressed the view that either a minimum service-hour requirement for ride-hailing vehicles should be stipulated, or an exit mechanism should be put in place, allowing returned permits to be reallocated to other individuals interested in providing ride-hailing services. Regarding the Government's proposal to stipulate a cap on the total number of ride-hailing vehicles but not on the number of drivers of ride-hailing vehicles, some Members were concerned that this might lead to the development of rental business for ride-hailing vehicles. They thus urged the Administration to perform proper gatekeeping in this regard. Furthermore, Members held divergent views on the requirement that vehicles should be less than seven years old at the time of initial application for a ride-hailing vehicle permit. Some considered the requirement too lax, which might affect passengers' riding experience, while others believed that the issue should be left for the market to decide, and the public can choose which platforms to use based on the age of vehicles provided by that platform, therefore no need to set an upper age limit on ride-hailing vehicles.

15. The Administration pointed out that opinions differed across society regarding the number of ride-hailing vehicles, and that there was no universal approach to this issue. Therefore, it was considered that a holistic view taking into account local actual circumstances and industry development must be taken. As nearly 90% of daily trips in Hong Kong were made using public transport services, the Administration deemed it necessary to impose over all control on the number of ride-hailing vehicles in order to optimize the use of limited road resources. The specific number would be prescribed in the subsidiary legislation. As to whether a rental business for ride-hailing vehicles would emerge under the regulatory framework, the Administration stressed that the positioning of ride-hailing service was to encourage the market to unlock the idle capacity of private cars and supplement the provision of personalized point-to-point transport services. On the vehicle age requirement, the Administration explained that the proposed vehicle age limit was set with reference to the current vehicle examination arrangements for private cars. Nevertheless, the Administration would continue to listen to views to avoid any negative impact on the supply of ride-hailing vehicles as well as passengers' travel experience.

## Regulation of drivers of ride-hailing vehicles

16. Members supported the Administration's proposal to allow holders of taxi driving licences to apply for the qualification to drive ride-hailing vehicles without having to sit for an additional test. This arrangement would expand employment options for taxi drivers and attract more newcomers to the trade. Some Members suggested merging taxi driving licences and ride-hailing vehicle driving permits, which would streamline procedures and increase the total supply of drivers for both taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. In addition, some Members supported imposing a levy on platform companies to help the taxi trade enhance service quality. They suggested that the resources could be used to subsidize frontline taxi drivers for refuelling or charging their vehicles, thereby reducing their operating expenses.

17. The Administration responded that ride-hailing vehicle drivers were required to pass a specific test and complete a pre-service course before commencing their driving services, in order to safeguard passenger safety and ensure service quality for ride-hailing vehicles. Considering that taxi drivers had already passed the taxi driving licence test, possessed experience of driving taxis, and had the knowledge required for providing passenger transport services, their skills were deemed sufficient for providing ride-hailing services. It was therefore proposed that holders of taxi driving licences be allowed to apply directly for qualification to drive ride-hailing vehicles. Meanwhile, the Administration was conducting a comprehensive review of the taxi written test and would consider whether the tests for providing taxi and ride-hailing services could be merged to facilitate those interested in joining the taxi and ride-hailing trades.
