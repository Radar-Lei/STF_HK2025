Strategic Research Framework for the Hong Kong Smart Traffic Fund: Navigating the Liberalization of Ride-Hailing Services1. Executive SummaryThe urban mobility landscape of Hong Kong stands at a historic inflection point. With the introduction of the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025, the territory is transitioning from a grey-market operation of ride-hailing services to a formalized, licensed regulatory regime.1 This legislative shift offers a profound opportunity to leverage the HK$1 billion Smart Traffic Fund (STF) established by the Transport Department.1 The STF aims to support projects that enhance convenience, efficiency, and safety for motorists and the commuting public. The convergence of this new funding vehicle with the liberalization of the ride-hailing market creates an urgent demand for rigorous, data-driven research that can guide policy implementation and technological adoption.This report outlines a comprehensive research strategy tailored for an STF application. It synthesizes global empirical evidence regarding the impacts of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) on congestion, public transit, and safety, drawing on studies from major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, San Francisco, and New Delhi.1 The analysis suggests that without careful management, the introduction of ride-hailing can exacerbate congestion through mechanisms such as deadheading and modal substitution.1 However, with the right technological interventions—such as smart fleet management and integrated Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms—these risks can be mitigated.This report presents four distinct, fully developed research proposals. Each proposal is designed to meet the specific objectives of the STF (convenience, efficiency, safety) while addressing the critical questions raised by the new legislative framework, such as the optimal number of vehicle permits and the prevention of illegal carriage.1 These proposals are structured to be "Research and Application" projects, aiming for the higher funding ceiling of HK$20 million 1, by combining rigorous academic methodology with tangible technological deliverables.2. Contextual Analysis: The Intersection of Policy and Urban Mobility2.1 The Legislative Shift in Hong KongThe Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 introduces a licensing regime for platforms, vehicles, and drivers.1 This tripartite regulation aims to solve the long-standing friction between incumbent taxi operators and insurgent platforms like Uber. The legislative framework is built upon a premise of "controlled supply," acknowledging that an unfettered entry of vehicles would be detrimental in a city where 90% of daily trips are made on public transport.1Key features of this legislation include a cap on the total number of ride-hailing vehicle permits to optimize road resource usage. This contrasts sharply with the open-market approach initially taken in the United States, which led to explosive fleet growth. Furthermore, the bill emphasizes platform accountability, requiring operators to conduct due diligence on drivers and vehicles, ensuring insurance coverage and service quality. Perhaps most significantly for enforcement, the bill proposes stricter penalties for illegal carriage, including the potential impoundment of vehicles and license suspension for drivers convicted of illegal hire.1 This legislative backdrop is crucial for any STF application; successful proposals must demonstrate how technology supports these regulatory goals: controlling fleet size, ensuring safety, and preventing the erosion of public transport ridership.2.2 The Global Evidence Base: A "Double-Edged Sword"Global literature presents TNCs as a double-edged sword for urban congestion. Theoretically, they offer the potential to reduce private car ownership and improve vehicle occupancy through pooling. However, empirical evidence often points to the contrary, creating a "congestion paradox" where the addition of efficient technology leads to inefficient road outcomes.The Congestion Penalty: Evidence from the US and IndiaResearch from San Francisco indicates that TNCs were the primary driver of congestion increases between 2010 and 2016. During this period, vehicle hours of delay (VHD) on weekdays increased by 62%. Counterfactual modeling suggests that without TNCs, this increase would have been only 22%.1 This massive disparity highlights the sheer volume of traffic generated by on-demand services in dense urban cores. Similarly, studies across US metropolitan areas found that TNC entry led to an increase in congestion intensity by 0.9% and, more critically, congestion duration by 4.5%.1 The takeaway is that TNCs do not just make traffic jams worse; they make them last longer into the day, eroding the concept of "off-peak" hours.Further evidence from Indian cities (New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) utilized driver strikes as natural experiments. This research demonstrated that the absence of ride-hailing led to significant reductions in travel times, particularly in the most congested districts during peak hours.1 In Mumbai, for example, travel times dropped by roughly 3.3% on average during strikes, with reductions up to 14.8% in the most congested zones.1 This causal link confirms that despite their utility, TNCs are a net contributor to friction on the road network.The Regulatory Counter-Narrative: Evidence from ChinaHowever, the narrative is not uniformly negative. Evidence from China provides a crucial counter-point that is highly relevant to Hong Kong's proposed "controlled" model. A study covering 98 Chinese cities found that the implementation of strict ride-hailing regulations—specifically those restricting driver residency (local hukou) and vehicle specifications—actually led to a 2.4% reduction in the congestion delay index.1 This suggests that when supply is constrained by policy (rather than left to the free market), the negative externalities can be curbed. This validates the Hong Kong government's decision to impose a cap on vehicle permits.1Mechanisms of CongestionUnderstanding why TNCs cause congestion is vital for designing STF projects. The literature identifies three primary mechanisms:MechanismDescriptionEmpirical EvidenceDeadheadingVehicles circulating empty while waiting for a dispatch or repositioning.In NYC and San Francisco, deadheading accounts for 20% to 50% of TNC Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).1 In India, significant congestion relief near airports during strikes suggested the elimination of empty circling vehicles.1Modal SubstitutionPassengers switching from high-efficiency transit to low-occupancy TNCs.TNC entry led to a net decline in transit ridership of 8.9% across US metropolitan areas.1 In Delhi, metro ridership spiked when TNCs went on strike.1Induced DemandNew trips generated by convenience that would not have occurred otherwise.Surveys indicate 43-61% of TNC trips substitute for walking, biking, or transit, or are induced entirely.1Relevance to Hong KongHong Kong’s extreme density and reliance on mass transit make it uniquely vulnerable to these negative externalities. If the new regulated ride-hailing fleet merely cannibalizes Mass Transit Railway (MTR) and bus ridership while increasing deadheading on arterial roads like Queen's Road Central, the policy will be a failure. Therefore, STF proposals must focus on mitigation technologies—algorithms and systems that enforce efficiency and complementarity rather than competition.3. Research Direction 1: Network Efficiency and Congestion ManagementProposal Title:Smart Fleet, Smooth City: An AI-Driven Assessment and Optimization System for Hong Kong’s Regulated Ride-Hailing EcosystemAlignment with STF Objectives:Enhancing efficiency of the road network or road space: By minimizing deadheading and optimizing pick-up/drop-off (PUDO) locations.Enhancing convenience of motorists: By reducing overall traffic friction caused by TNC cruising.1. ObjectivesThe primary objective of this project is to develop a dynamic monitoring and optimization framework for the newly licensed ride-hailing fleet. Unlike previous retrospective studies that analyzed congestion after the damage was done 1, this project aims to be proactive.Quantify the "Net Impact": Use diverse empirical methodologies (Difference-in-Differences) to measure the causal impact of the new licensing regime on Central Business District (CBD) congestion speeds, distinguishing between "regulated" and "illegal" fleet behaviors.Minimize Deadheading: Develop dispatch algorithms that reduce the ratio of empty cruising miles to revenue miles, tailored to Hong Kong's specific road topology.Optimize Kerbside Management: Identify and mitigate the friction caused by PUDO activities in high-density zones (e.g., Central, Causeway Bay) using computer vision analysis.2. Research ComponentsComponent A: The "Natural Experiment" Impact AssessmentLeveraging the legislative rollout as a "shock" to the transport system, this component will replicate and adapt the rigorous methodologies seen in studies of Chicago and Indian cities.1Methodology: A Difference-in-Differences (DID) model will be constructed. The "treatment" group will be road segments with high density of licensed ride-hailing activity (identified via platform data or proxy measures), and the "control" group will be segments with historically low TNC usage but similar traffic characteristics. Alternatively, if the rollout is phased by vehicle type or district, this staggered entry will be exploited.Data Strategy: High-frequency traffic speed data (e.g., from TomTom or Google APIs) will be aggregated at 15-minute intervals. This mirrors the granular approach taken in the Chicago congestion tax study, which found significant heterogeneity across different times of day (e.g., morning peaks vs. evening peaks).1Hypothesis Testing: The research will test whether the cap on vehicle permits 1 successfully prevents the congestion spikes seen in deregulated markets like San Francisco 1, or if the remaining fleet intensifies utilization (and thus deadheading) to meet demand. The analysis will specifically look for the "duration extension" effect noted in US studies, where congestion spreads into shoulder hours.1Component B: Deadheading and Route Choice AnalysisEvidence from India suggests that TNCs may induce vehicles to take longer routes to avoid congestion, or conversely, that their absence opens up shorter routes.1 This implies that standard speed metrics might underestimate the total inefficiency if vehicles are moving fast but taking circuitous paths.Deadheading Index: We will develop a "Deadheading Index" for Hong Kong districts. This involves analyzing the gap between trip requests and vehicle availability to calculate the idle miles generated per revenue mile. This addresses the concern raised in the literature regarding full-time drivers (common in India and likely in a regulated HK market) generating more deadhead miles than part-time casual drivers.1Simulation Modeling: Using the volume-delay functions (VDFs) described in the San Francisco study 1, we will simulate a counterfactual Hong Kong where the fleet cap is adjusted up or down by 20%. This will directly inform the Transport Department's decision on the final number of permits.1Component C: Smart PUDO Management System (Application Deliverable)The "Application" portion of this project involves building a Smart Kerbside Management System. The San Francisco study highlighted that PUDO activities disrupt traffic flow significantly, acting as temporary capacity reductions.1Technology: Deploying edge-computing cameras or utilizing existing CCTV feeds at hotspots to detect PUDO events.Algorithm: Machine learning models will quantify the "lane blockage duration" caused by pick-ups versus drop-offs. The system will output real-time recommendations for "Virtual Loading Zones"—dynamically assigning PUDO spots to side streets to clear arterial flow.Deliverable: A dashboard for the Transport Department showing real-time congestion hotspots caused by ride-hailing activities, with predictive capabilities to adjust geofencing restrictions during peak hours.3. Expected Outcomes and ImpactThis project addresses the government's need to determine the "specific number" of permits based on scientific evidence.1 By proving whether the regulated fleet improves or worsens efficiency compared to the previous grey market, this research provides the empirical backbone for future quota adjustments. The Smart PUDO system directly enhances road space efficiency, a core STF objective.4. Research Direction 2: Multi-Modal Integration and Public TransitProposal Title:Synergistic Mobility: Optimizing Regulated Ride-Hailing as a First-Mile Connector for Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR)Alignment with STF Objectives:Enhancing convenience of motorists: By reducing private car dependency.Enhancing efficiency of the road network: By shifting long-haul trips from road to rail.1. ObjectivesHong Kong's transport hierarchy prioritizes mass carriers (MTR/Bus). A critical risk identified in the literature is that TNCs substitute for transit rather than complementing it. In the US, TNC entry led to an 8.9% drop in transit ridership.1 However, the same study found a glimmer of hope: in "top transit cities" (like New York or Boston), TNCs actually helped reduce private vehicle ownership by about 1%.1 This suggests complementarity is possible in dense networks. This proposal aims to engineer this outcome for Hong Kong.Analyze Substitution vs. Complementarity: Determine the degree to which current ride-hailing trips replace MTR journeys versus private car trips.Design Integrated Fare Mechanisms: Research the economic feasibility of "bundled" fares (MTR + Ride-hail) to incentivize feeder trips.Develop a MaaS Interoperability Standard: Create a technical framework for data exchange between the licensed platforms and public transit operators.2. Research ComponentsComponent A: Spatial-Temporal Substitution ModelingThis component investigates the relationship between TNC trips and public transit availability using the methodology from the US MSA study.1Methodology: We will regress ride-hailing trip volumes against MTR station proximity and service frequency. The model will control for variables such as GDP, population density, and weather.The "Rail-Gap" Hypothesis: We will test the hypothesis that TNC demand is highest where transit connectivity is lowest (complementarity) or where transit is crowded but available (substitution). The Indian study 1 showed significant substitution during strikes (people moved to the metro when Uber stopped). We need to invert this analysis: does the presence of TNCs pull people off the MTR in Hong Kong?Data Sources: Integration of MTR gate entry/exit data with anonymized ride-hailing trip samples (derived from the new licensed platform reporting requirements suggested in 1).Component B: The "Transit-Feeder" ExperimentTo actively shape behavior, this component involves a pilot experiment designed to test the "complementary" findings from the literature.1Pilot Design: In a selected sub-district (e.g., parts of the New Territories with lower rail density), recruit a cohort of commuters.Intervention: Offer subsidized ride-hailing trips only if they start or end at a designated MTR station (verified via GPS geofencing). This mimics the incentives that theoretically lead to reduced car ownership.Analysis: Compare the net Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT) of these multimodal trips against private car trips. Does this "bundle" actually reduce road usage, or does it just induce new trips?Component C: The Integrated MaaS Protocol (Application Deliverable)The technological output will be a Universal API Standard for Licensed Fleets.Problem: Currently, ride-hailing data is siloed. To enable true integration, the MTR and TNCs need to "speak" to each other.Solution: Develop a secure, privacy-preserving API that allows licensed platforms to push trip data to a central government repository (as suggested by Legislative Council members 1) and receive real-time transit status updates.Feature: A "Green Routing" engine that pushes ride-hailing apps to suggest MTR interchanges for long trips, prioritizing the efficiency of the road network.3. Expected Outcomes and ImpactThis proposal directly addresses the Legislative Council's concern about ride-hailing competing unfairly with mass transit. By creating technological and economic structures that bias the market toward feeder trips, the project helps safeguard the financial sustainability of public transport while enhancing commuter convenience. The deliverable (MaaS API) lays the groundwork for a future "Super App" for Hong Kong mobility.5. Research Direction 3: Driving Safety and TelematicsProposal Title:Vision Zero for the Gig Economy: Next-Generation Telematics and Driver Behavior Monitoring for Licensed Point-to-Point TransportAlignment with STF Objectives:Improving driving safety: By detecting and correcting dangerous driving behaviors.1. ObjectivesThe new Bill allows taxi drivers to transition to ride-hailing without new tests, assuming their skills are sufficient.1 However, the incentive structures of gig-economy driving (speed incentives, fatigue from long shifts) differ from traditional taxi driving. The literature presents a mixed picture on safety: while some studies suggest ride-hailing reduces alcohol-related homicides 1, others point to increased accident risks due to curbside disruption and distracted driving. This project aims to:Establish a Safety Baseline: Compare the safety metrics (accident rates, harsh braking, speeding) of licensed ride-hailing vehicles against traditional taxis.Detect Fatigue and Distraction: Develop non-intrusive monitoring systems to enforce the safety standards required by the new licensing regime.Create a "Safety Scorecard": A unified rating system for drivers across platforms.2. Research ComponentsComponent A: Comparative Safety AnalyticsUsing accident data and telematics, we will analyze the safety profile of the new fleet.Literature Context: We must account for the specific operational model of Indian drivers who work full-time and face high fatigue 1, which Benjaafar et al. (2022) suggest leads to different congestion and safety outcomes than part-time US drivers. Since Hong Kong’s taxi-to-TNC converts will likely be full-time, this Indian model is more relevant than the US model.Methodology: Equip a sample of 500 licensed ride-hailing vehicles and 500 taxis with identical OBD-II telematics dongles. Collect data on acceleration, cornering, and speeding.Analysis: Perform a comparative analysis. Do ride-hailing drivers drive more aggressively to meet algorithmic deadlines? Does the "rating system" mandated by the new Bill 1 actually correlate with safer driving, or just politeness?Component B: AI-Based Fatigue Detection System (Application Deliverable)The government mandates platforms to ensure safety.1 This component builds the tool to do it.Technology: Develop a smartphone-based AI module (using the driver's existing phone camera) to detect signs of microsleep or distraction (e.g., looking at the phone for dispatch excessively).Privacy-First Design: To address privacy concerns raised during legislative consultation 1, the video feed is processed locally on the device; only the "fatigue alerts" are transmitted to the platform.Intervention Logic: When fatigue is detected, the system automatically suspends the driver from receiving new orders for a set period. This operationalizes the "duty of care" required of platforms.Component C: The Unified Driver Safety LedgerConcept: A blockchain-based or secure database ledger that tracks a driver's safety history across different platforms.Relevance: Drivers may switch between platforms (Uber, other entrants) or between taxi and ride-hailing work. A unified ledger ensures that a driver banned for unsafe driving on Platform A cannot immediately drive for Platform B, closing a regulatory loophole. This directly supports the government's mechanism to disqualify drivers for offenses.13. Expected Outcomes and ImpactThis project provides the technological enforcement mechanisms necessary for the new Bill's safety provisions. It moves regulation from "reactive" (punishing accidents) to "proactive" (preventing them via telematics). This aligns perfectly with the STF’s safety mandate and addresses public concerns about the quality of ride-hailing drivers.6. Research Direction 4: Economic Equilibrium and Pricing StrategiesProposal Title:Market Balance in a Dual-Regime: Algorithmic Pricing and Permit Allocation Strategies for Hong Kong’s Personalized Transport SectorAlignment with STF Objectives:Enhancing convenience of motorists: By ensuring availability through proper supply management.Enhancing efficiency: By using pricing to smooth demand.1. ObjectivesThe legislative framework leaves technical details like the number of permits and fees to subsidiary legislation.1 This creates a critical research gap. If the cap is too low, illegal carriage returns. If too high, congestion explodes, as seen in New York where VMT doubled in two years.1Determine Optimal Fleet Size: Use econometric modeling to find the "sweet spot" number of permits that balances availability with congestion mitigation.Analyze Pricing Controls: Investigate the impact of "Surge Pricing" vs. "Congestion Pricing."Simulate Congestion Pricing for TNCs: Assess the viability of a specific congestion charge for ride-hailing trips in the CBD, drawing on the Chicago experience.12. Research ComponentsComponent A: Supply-Demand Equilibrium ModelingMethodology: Develop an agent-based model of Hong Kong's transport market. Agents (passengers) make mode choices based on price and wait time; Agents (drivers) supply labor based on earnings.Scenario Analysis: Calibrate the model using data from the "unregulated" era and simulate the new "capped" era. We will incorporate the "short-term vs. long-term" elasticity findings from the literature—specifically that while ride-hailing might reduce car ownership in the long run, it induces congestion in the short run.1Key Metric: The "Wait-Time vs. Congestion" curve. We aim to identify the point where adding one more permit yields diminishing returns for wait times but creates linear increases in congestion (the marginal social cost).Component B: The Pricing Impact Study (Lessons from Chicago)Context: The Chicago study 1 offers a vital lesson: a congestion tax ($3 downtown vs $1.25 shared) significantly reduced ride-hailing demand (10.6% drop overall, 14.7% for solo trips) but only marginally improved traffic speeds (0.8% improvement).Implication for HK: This suggests that pricing alone may be insufficient to solve congestion if TNCs represent a small but disruptive fraction of total traffic. The research will simulate whether Hong Kong's proposed quantity cap 1 is more effective than Chicago's price instrument.Elasticity Analysis: We will determine the price elasticity of HK commuters. Will a surcharge push them to the MTR (as Chicago's tax reduced demand), or will they absorb the cost? We will specifically look at the heterogeneity of this effect—Chicago showed short trips were more sensitive to tax than long trips.1Component C: Regulatory Dashboard for Permit Allocation (Application Deliverable)Tool: A decision-support tool for the Transport Department.Function: Input current traffic speeds and taxi vacancy rates -> Output recommendation for the release or retraction of ride-hailing permits for the next quarter. This creates a data-driven "flexible cap" rather than a rigid static number.3. Expected Outcomes and ImpactThis proposal addresses the economic core of the legislation. It provides the government with the mathematical justification for the permit cap and fee structures. It ensures that the "healthy competition" mentioned in the Bill 1 is engineered rather than left to chance.7. Methodological Frameworks and Data StrategyTo ensure these proposals are robust enough for the STF, a unified data strategy is required, drawing on the best practices identified in the research materials.7.1 Data Acquisition StrategyResearch relies on data availability. The new legislation 1 implies that platforms will have to share data with the government. The STF proposals should leverage this:Platform Data: Trip start/end times, locations, fare, and vehicle status (cruising vs. hired). This is standard in NYC and Chicago studies.1 The Chicago dataset, which aggregated data to census tracts to protect privacy while allowing granular analysis 1, serves as the model for Hong Kong's data privacy compliance.Probe Data: High-frequency GPS data (Google Maps/TomTom) to measure background traffic speeds, independent of the platforms.1 This was critical in the Indian study to validate the congestion drop during strikes.Public Transit Data: Octopus card data (anonymized) to track transit flows and substitution effects.7.2 Analytical TechniquesDifference-in-Differences (DID): As used in the Mumbai and Chicago studies 1, DID is the gold standard for causal inference. We will use the date of the legislation's enforcement as the cut-off to measure pre- and post-implementation effects. The "parallel trend assumption" verified in Chicago 1 will be a key validity check for HK data.Counterfactual Simulation: Following the San Francisco methodology 1, we will build a model of "HK 2026 without regulated TNCs" (business as usual) and compare it to "HK 2026 with regulated TNCs" to isolate the policy's specific impact.8. ConclusionThe introduction of a regulatory framework for ride-hailing in Hong Kong is not merely a legal update; it is a systemic reset of the city's mobility ecosystem. The evidence from international markets—ranging from the congestion spirals in San Francisco to the deadheading challenges in India and the regulatory successes in China—demonstrates that this transition carries significant risks if not managed with precision.The four research directions outlined above offer a comprehensive roadmap for the Smart Traffic Fund. They move beyond simple observation to active management: Direction 1 quantifies the problem using global best practices; Direction 2 integrates the solution with public transit to prevent the ridership erosion seen in the US; Direction 3 ensures operational safety in a gig-economy context; and Direction 4 stabilizes the economic market using lessons from Chicago's pricing experiments.By funding these targeted "Research and Application" projects, the Transport Department can ensure that the liberalization of ride-hailing serves its intended purpose: enhancing the convenience of the public without compromising the efficiency and safety of Hong Kong's world-class transport network. The outputs—ranging from AI-driven enforcement tools to MaaS integration standards—will provide the digital infrastructure necessary to govern the physical reality of the new fleet.9.
