General Notes

## Background

1. In the 2019 Policy Address Supplement, the Chief Executive announced the setup of the Fund to promote research and application of vehicle-related innovation and technology for enhancing the convenience and efficiency of motorists as well as improving their driving safety, etc. \$1 billion have been earmarked for the Fund which commences operation in 2020-21.

2. A Management Committee has been set up to vet and approve applications under the Fund and monitor the implementation of the Fund. The Hong Kong Productivity Council has been appointed as the Smart Traffic Fund Secretariat (the Secretariat) to provide secretariat support and technical advice to the Management Committee.

## Scope of the Fund

3. The Fund aims to provide support for enterprises or organisations to conduct research and application on vehicle-related innovation and technology with at least one of the following objectives:

- improving driving safety.

4. The Fund provides funding support for research and application projects as well as pure research projects.

5. The maximum funding support is up to 50% of the Estimated Project Cost, which is the sum of all estimated expenditures to be incurred (including items to be covered by the Applicant's contribution), for corporate sector Applicants, and up to 90% for public sector Applicants. For a project to be carried out jointly by Applicants from corporate sector and public sector, the maximum funding support is up to 50% of the Estimated Project Cost for involving public sector (except the Public Sector Research Institutions) or 70% of the Estimated Project Cost for involving the Public Sector Research Institutions. For a research and application project for taxi fleet to be carried out by the Applicant who is a Taxi Fleet Licensee, the maximum funding support is up to 70% of the Estimated Project Cost. Actual funding to be disbursed will depend on the actual project expenditure. For definitions of corporate sector and public sector Applicants, and Public Sector Research Institutions, please refer to part A of this Guide.

6. For research and application projects, the maximum funding support is HK\$20 million per project. For pure research projects, the maximum funding support is HK\$8 million per project.

(2) Failure to so procure or any act of offering, soliciting or accepting advantage referred to in (1) above committed by the Supplier or by a director, employee, agent or subcontractor of the Supplier shall, without affecting the Supplier's liability for such failure and act, result in his quotation/tender being invalidated.

(3) The Procurer shall report all suspected instances of corruption to the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

## ANTI-COLLUSION AND ANTI BID-RIGGING

(1) By submitting a quotation/tender, the Supplier represents and warrants that in relation to the invitation of quotation/tender:

(i) it will make reference to the Guidelines of Independent Commission Against Corruption and Competition Commission;

(ii) it has not communicated and will not communicate to any person other than the Procurer the amount of any quotation/tender price;

(iii) it has not fixed and will not fix the amount of any quotation/tender price by arrangement with any person;

(iv) it has not made and will not make any arrangement with any person as to whether it or that other person will or will not submit a quotation/tender;

(v) it has not otherwise colluded and will not otherwise collude with any person in any manner whatsoever in the quotation/tender process; and

(vi) it will notify and seek prior approval from the Procurer of all subcontracting arrangements after awarding the contract.

(2) In the event that the Supplier is in breach of any of the representations and/or warranties in Clause (1) above, the Procurer shall be entitled to, without compensation to any person or liability on the part of the Procurer:

(i) reject the quotation/tender;

(ii) if the Procurer has accepted the quotation/tender, withdraw its acceptance of the quotation/tender; and

(iii) if the Procurer has entered into the contract with the Supplier, terminate the contract.

(3) The Supplier shall indemnify and keep indemnified the Procurer against all losses, damages, costs or expenses arising out of or in relation to any breach of any of the representations and/or warranties in Clause (1) above.

(4) A breach by a Supplier of any of the representations and/or warranties in Clause (1) may prejudice its future standing as a supplier or service provider of the Procurer.

(5) Clause (1) shall not apply to agreements, arrangements, communications, understandings, promises or undertakings with:

(i) the Procurer;

(ii) a joint venture partner, where joint venture arrangements relevant to the bid exist and which are notified to the Procurer;

(iii) consultants or sub-contractors, provided that the communications are held in strict confidence and limited to the information required to facilitate that particular consultancy arrangement or sub-contract;

(iv) professional advisers, provided that the communications are held in strict confidence and limited to the information required for the adviser to render their professional advice in relation to the Tender;

(v) insurers or brokers for the purpose of obtaining an insurance quote, provided that the communications are held in strict confidence and limited to the information required to facilitate that particular insurance arrangement; and

(vi) banks for the purpose of obtaining financing for the Contract, provided that the communications are held in strict confidence and limited to the information required to facilitate that financing.

For the avoidance of doubt, the making of a bid by a bidder to the Procurer in public during an auction will not by itself be regarded as a breach of the representation and warranty in Clause (1) above.

(6) The rights of the Procurer under Clauses (2) to (4) above are in addition to and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to it against the Supplier.

(7) Bid-rigging is inherently anti-competitive and is considered serious anti-competitive conduct under the Competition Ordinance (Cap.619). Supplier who engages in bid-rigging conduct may be liable for the imposition of pecuniary penalties and other sanctions under the Competition Ordinance. The Procurer may, at its discretion, report all suspected instances of bid-rigging to the Competition Commission and provide the Competition Commission with any relevant information, including but not limited to information on the Supplier's quotation/tender and personal information.

Please complete and return the attached confirmation for your quotation/tender. However, you are reminded that by submitting a quotation/tender, irrespectively of whether the attached confirmation is completed/returned, the Supplier represents and warrants that it has agreed to abide by the probity, anti-collusion and anti bid-rigging requirements as set out above.

Yours faithfully,
